Nook Radio should be live now at [https://nook-radio.netlify.app](https://nook-radio.netlify.app). For now, it only plays the hourly background music for your current time and location (location needs to be shared with the browser).

The next step is to create Spotify- or YouTube Music-like player for all the songs.
